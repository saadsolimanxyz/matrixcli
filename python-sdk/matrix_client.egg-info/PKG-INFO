        This is a Matrix client-server SDK for Python 2.7 and 3.4+
        
        Community discussion on usage of this SDK and development of this SDK can be
        found at `#matrix-python-sdk:matrix.org`_.
        
        Documentation can be found at http://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-python-sdk/

        Project Status
        --------------
        
        This sdk is currently lightly maintained (without any sort of official or
        semi-official "lead" maintainer). In general pull-requests might be reviewed but
        little to no new-feature or bug-fix development is happening outside of that.
        For more info or to volunteer to help, please see
        https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/issues/279. Or come chat in
        `#matrix-python-sdk:matrix.org`_.
        
        Installation
        ============
        Stable release
        --------------
        Install with pip from pypi. This will install all necessary dependencies as well.
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           pip install matrix_client
        
        Development version
        -------------------
        Install using ``setup.py`` in root project directory. This will also install all
        needed dependencies.
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk.git
           cd matrix-python-sdk
           python setup.py install
        
        E2E development
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The Olm bindings are not yet hosted on PyPI. Hence it it necessary to pass
        ``--process-dependency-links`` when installing with pip, in order to fetch them
        from their Git repository. For example replace ``python setup.py install`` in
        the above instructions by ``pip install --process-dependency-links .[e2e]``.
        
        Usage
        =====
        The SDK provides 2 layers of interaction. The low-level layer just wraps the
        raw HTTP API calls. The high-level layer wraps the low-level layer and provides
        an object model to perform actions on.
        
        Client:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from matrix_client.client import MatrixClient
        
            client = MatrixClient("http://localhost:8008")
        
            # New user
            token = client.register_with_password(username="foobar", password="monkey")
        
            # Existing user
            token = client.login(username="foobar", password="monkey")
        
            room = client.create_room("my_room_alias")
            room.send_text("Hello!")
        
        
        API:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from matrix_client.api import MatrixHttpApi
        
            matrix = MatrixHttpApi("https://matrix.org", token="some_token")
            response = matrix.send_message("!roomid:matrix.org", "Hello!")
        
        
        Structure
        =========
        The SDK is split into two modules: ``api`` and ``client``.
        
        API
        ---
        This contains the raw HTTP API calls and has minimal business logic. You can
        set the access token (``token``) to use for requests as well as set a custom
        transaction ID (``txn_id``) which will be incremented for each request.
        
        Client
        ------
        This encapsulates the API module and provides object models such as ``Room``.
        
        Samples
        =======
        A collection of samples are included, written in Python 3.
        
        You can either install the SDK, or run the sample like this:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            PYTHONPATH=. python samples/samplename.py
        
        Building the Documentation
        ==========================
        
        The documentation can be built by installing ``sphinx`` and ``sphinx_rtd_theme``.
        
        Simple run ``make`` inside ``docs`` which will list the avaliable output formats.
